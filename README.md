# SkyWatch API v0.2
### Overview
Through the API you can access the following climate and atmospheric datasets:
* [AIRS](http://www.skywatch.co/airs) (Level 2 and 3)
* [GOSAT/ACOS](http://www.skywatch.co/gosat) (Level 2 and 3)
* [MOPITT](http://www.skywatch.co/mopitt) (Level 1 and 3)
* [OCO-2](http://www.skywatch.co/oco2) (Level 2 only)
* [TES](http://www.skywatch.co/tes) (Level 2 and 3)

You can use the API to search datasets by data level, location, and date. The JSON response will return a signed URL to download the datasets that meet the search criteria.

### API Usage
```curl -H "x-api-key: <api key>" https://cqh77pglf1.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/data/level/<level>/location/<coordinates>/time/<times>```

Where:

**api key**

A personal alphanumeric api key will be provided to you upon request. If you werenâ€™t provided a key, or have any issues using the key provided, please contact dexter@skywatch.co.

**level**

The data level is an optional path of the API URL that corresponds to the [data processing levels](http://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-science-data/data-processing-levels-for-eosdis-data-products/) for Earth observation data. Level 1, level 2 and level 3 datasets are available. If no data level is specified, datasets of all levels will be returned.

**coordinates**

A list of longitude, latitude coordinate pairs as a flat, comma-separated list. A list of two numbers represents a point, four numbers is a square area where the coordinates are the corners, or if there are more than four numbers the coordinates represent a closed polygon, where the first point equals the last point in the list. Because this list represents a number of points, there always has to be an even number of numbers in the list.

*Examples:* 
* Point: -71.1043443253,-42.3150676016
* Square:  -71.1043443253471,-42.3150676015829,71.1043443253471,42.3150676015829
* Polygon: -71.1043443253471,-42.3150676015829,71.1043443253471,-42.3150676015829,71.1043443253471,42.3150676015829,-71.1043443253471,42.3150676015829,-71.1043443253471,-42.3150676015829

**<times>** 

One or two UTC timestamps in ISO format (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssss+|-zzzz). Partial dates can also be specified: 2009, 2009-12, 2009-12-25, 2009-12-25T13:25:00.0000+0000. If no time is specified, midnight UTC on the day in question is assumed. 

If only one timestamp is passed in, a one day range is assumed. For example, if 2009-12-25 is specified, the search takes place as if 2009-12-25,2009-12-26 was specified.

### Example API Call

```curl -H "x-api-key: 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p" https://cqh77pglf1.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/data/level/2/location/-71.1043443253471,-42.3150676015829/time/2009-12-25```

```curl -H "x-api-key: 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p" https://cqh77pglf1.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/data/location/-71.1043443253471,-42.3150676015829/time/2009-12-25```

If you get a status 200, you will receive a JSON list of CO2 satellite data files that match the criteria, their sizes, and signed URL to download. The signed URLs **expire 1 hour after being generated.**

*Excerpt of a JSON response:*
